## Deadlock

### Definition:

A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource that they need to continue execution. None of the processes can proceed, creating a circular dependency.

### Example:

- Banking System Scenario

```
# Process A needs Account1 and Account2
# Process B needs Account2 and Account1

Process A:
1. Lock Account1 ‚úÖ
2. Wait for Account2 ‚è≥ (held by Process B)

Process B:
1. Lock Account2 ‚úÖ
2. Wait for Account1 ‚è≥ (held by Process A)

Result: Both processes wait forever! üîÑ
```

- Traffic Intersection Analogy
  Imagine four cars at a 4-way intersection:

1. Each car occupies one lane
2. Each needs the lane occupied by the next car
3. No car can move forward
4. Result: Complete gridlock!
