## Deadlock

### Definition:

A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource that they need to continue execution. None of the processes can proceed, creating a circular dependency.

### Example:

- Banking System Scenario

```
# Process A needs Account1 and Account2
# Process B needs Account2 and Account1

Process A:
1. Lock Account1 ✅
2. Wait for Account2 ⏳ (held by Process B)

Process B:
1. Lock Account2 ✅
2. Wait for Account1 ⏳ (held by Process A)

Result: Both processes wait forever! 🔄
```

- Traffic Intersection Analogy
  Imagine four cars at a 4-way intersection:

1. Each car occupies one lane
2. Each needs the lane occupied by the next car
3. No car can move forward
4. Result: Complete gridlock!

## Database Normalization

### Definition:

Database Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.
**Normalization Forms:**
1NF: Each column contains atomic values, no repeating groups
2NF: 1NF + All non-key attributes fully depend on primary key
3NF: 2NF + No transitive dependencies
BCNF: 3NF + Every determinant is a candidate key

### Example:

**Student Database Normalization**

Before Normalization:

```
Students Table:
+----+----------+-------------+------------------+----------------+
| ID | Name     | Courses     | Instructors      | Departments    |

| 2  | Sarah    | Physics     | Brown            | Physics        |
+----+----------+-------------+------------------+----------------+
```

After 1NF(First Normal Form):

```

## Test Driven Development

### Definition:

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the actual code. It follows a simple cycle: Red → Green → Refactor.
TDD Cycle:

- Red: Write a failing test
- Green: Write minimal code to make the test pass
- Refactor: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

### Example:

Calculator Addition Function
**Step 1: Red - Write Failing Test**

```
import unittest

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_two_numbers(self):
        calc = Calculator()
        result = calc.add(2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_add_negative_numbers(self):
        calc = Calculator()
        result = calc.add(-1, -2)
        self.assertEqual(result, -3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Step 2: Green - Write Minimal Code**

```
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
```

**Step 3: Refactor - Improve Code**

```
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """Add two numbers and return the result."""
        if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
            raise TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers")
        return a + b
```

## Lazy Loading

### Definition:

Lazy Loading is a design pattern that delays the initialization or loading of resources until they are actually needed, rather than loading everything upfront. This improves performance by reducing initial load time and memory usage.

**Benefits vs Trade-offs**

- Benefits: Faster initial load, Lower memory usage, Better user experience
- Trade-offs: Potential delay when accessing, More complex implementation, Possible loading indicators needed

### Example:

- Web Development - Image Lazy Loading

```
<!-- Images load only when they come into viewport -->
<img src="placeholder.jpg" data-src="actual-image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Example">
```

- JavaScript - Module Lazy Loading

```
// Module is loaded only when function is called
async function loadFeature() {
    const module = await import('./heavy-feature.js');
    return module.default();
}
```

## Eager Loading

### Definition:

Eager Loading is a technique where data or resources are loaded immediately when they are declared or referenced, rather than waiting until they are actually needed. This approach prioritizes upfront loading to ensure data is readily available when accessed.

- **Eager Loading vs Lazy Loading**
  |Aspect |Eager Loading |Lazy Loading |
  |--- |--- |--- |
  |Loading Time |Load immediately/upfront |Load when needed |
  |Memory Usage |Higher initial memory consumption |Lower initial memory usage |
  |Performance |Faster access after loading |Slower first access, faster subsequent |
  |Network Requests |More upfront requests |Fewer initial requests |
  |Use Case |Critical data needed immediately |Optional/conditional data |

### Example:

- Database Query

```
# Eager Loading Example - SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

# Load user with all their posts immediately
user = session.query(User)\
    .options(joinedload(User.posts))\
    .filter(User.id == 1)\
    .first()

# Posts are already loaded - no additional query needed
print(user.posts)  # ✅ Data already available
```

- Javascript

```
// Eager Loading Example - JavaScript
class ImageGallery {
    constructor(imageUrls) {
        this.images = [];
        this.loadAllImages(imageUrls); // Load immediately
    }

    loadAllImages(urls) {
        urls.forEach(url => {
            const img = new Image();
            img.src = url; // Load all images upfront
            this.images.push(img);
        });
    }
}

// All images start loading immediately
const gallery = new ImageGallery(['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg']);
```

- Action - What the candidate specifically did
- Result - The outcome achieved
- Learning - What was learned from the experience

### Example:

**Leadership Challenge**

Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to lead a difficult project."

Candidate's CARL Response:

🔍 Context:

"In my previous role as a software team lead, we had a critical e-commerce platform that was experiencing 40% performance degradation during peak hours, affecting customer sales."

⚡ Action:

"I assembled a cross-functional team, implemented daily standups, analyzed the codebase to identify bottlenecks, prioritized database optimization, and coordinated with DevOps for infrastructure scaling."

📊 Result:

"We reduced page load times by 60%, improved system stability to 99.8% uptime, and recovered $2M in potential lost sales within 3 weeks."

📚 Learning:

"I learned the importance of proactive monitoring and that effective leadership requires both technical problem-solving and clear communication across departments."

## RAFT algorithm

### Definition:

RAFT (Replicated And Fault Tolerant) is a consensus algorithm designed to manage distributed systems by ensuring all nodes agree on a shared state, even when some nodes fail. It's simpler and more understandable than Paxos.

Key Concepts

- Leader Election: One node becomes the leader to coordinate operations
- Log Replication: Leader replicates entries to follower nodes
- Safety: Ensures consistency across all nodes

### Example:

Banking System

Scenario: 5-node banking cluster processing account transfers

```
Initial State:
Node A (Leader) | Node B | Node C | Node D | Node E
Balance: $1000  | $1000  | $1000  | $1000  | $1000
```

Step 1: Client Request

```
Client → Transfer $200 from Account X to Account Y
```

Step 2: Leader Processing

```
Node A (Leader):
1. Receives transfer request
2. Creates log entry: "Transfer $200 X→Y"
3. Sends to followers for replication
```

Step 3: Consensus

```
Node A → Node B: "Append log entry #5"
Node A → Node C: "Append log entry #5"
Node A → Node D: "Append log entry #5"
Node A → Node E: "Append log entry #5"

Responses:
✅ Node B: "Committed"
✅ Node C: "Committed"
❌ Node D: "Failed" (network issue)
✅ Node E: "Committed"

Result: 3/5 nodes = Majority achieved ✅
```

Step 4: Commit

```
Final State (majority nodes):
Node A | Node B | Node C | Node E
Balance: $800   | $800   | $800   | $800
(Node D will sync when reconnected)
```

## Currying (Functional Programming Technique)

### Definition:

Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

### Example:

```
def multiply(x):
    def inner(y):
        return x * y
    return inner

# Usage:
mul_by_3 = multiply(3)
result = mul_by_3(5)   # result is 15

# Or, in one line:
result = multiply(3)(5)  # result is 15

```

Explanation:

```
multiply(3)
```

returns a function that multiplies its argument by 3.

## Replica Technique in System Design

### Definition:
Replica Technique is a design pattern used in distributed systems to enhance reliability, availability, and performance by creating multiple copies (replicas) of data or services across different nodes.

Key Benefits
⚡ High Availability - System remains operational even if some replicas fail
🚀 Performance - Reduced latency through geographical distribution
🛡️ Fault Tolerance - Data redundancy prevents single point of failure
📈 Scalability - Load distribution across multiple replicas

Types of Replication:
- **Master-Slave Replication**: One master node handles writes, while multiple slave nodes handle reads. Use case: Read-heavy applications like web servers.
- **Master-Master Replication**: Multiple nodes can handle both reads and writes. Use case: High write availability systems where any node can accept writes.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: All nodes are equal, and each can read/write data. Use case: disributed systems like blockchain.

### Example:
E-commerce Database Replication(scenario: Amazon-like online store)

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Master    │    │   Slave 1   │    │   Slave 2   │
│  Database   │───▶│  (US East)  │    │  (Europe)   │
│   (Main)    │    │             │    │             │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │
       ▼                   ▼                   ▼
   All Writes         Read Queries        Read Queries
   (Orders, Users)    (Product Info)     (Product Info)
```

Implementation Strategy
- Master Database 🎯

Handles all write operations (new orders, user registration)
Located in primary data center

- Read Replicas 📖

Handle read queries (product searches, user profiles)
Distributed globally for reduced latency

- Replication Process 🔄
```
-- Master receives write
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, amount) 
VALUES (123, 456, 99.99);

-- Changes replicated to slaves asynchronously
-- Users in different regions read from nearest replica
```
