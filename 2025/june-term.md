## Polya Problem Solving Technique

### definition:

George Polya developed a systematic approach to problem-solving with four key steps:

1. Understand the problem
   *What is the unknown?
   *What are the given data?
   \*What are the conditions?
2. Devise a plan
   *Look for patterns
   *Work backwards
   *Use analogies
   *Break into smaller problems
3. Carry out the plan
   *Execute your strategy
   *Check each step
   \*Be patient and persistent
4. Look back
   *Check the result
   *Can you verify the answer?
   \*Can you use this method elsewhere?

### example:

Problem: At a party with 10 people, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes occur?

- Step 1: Understand ðŸ¤”
  Unknown: Total number of handshakes
  Given: 10 people, each shakes hands once with every other person
  Condition: No person shakes hands with themselves
- Step 2: Plan ðŸ“Š
  Strategy: Use combinations formula
  Each handshake involves exactly 2 people
  Choose 2 people from 10: C(10,2)
- Step 3: Execute ðŸ”¢  
  C(10,2) = 10!/(2!(10-2)!) = (10 Ã— 9)/2 = 45
- Step 4: Verify âœ¨
  - Check: Person 1 shakes 9 hands, Person 2 shakes 8 remaining, etc.
  - Sum: 9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 45 âœ…
  - Answer: 45 handshakes
