## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Definition:

CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates the operations that **change** state (Commands) from the operations that **read** state (Queries), giving each its own model, its own code path, and often its own data store and scaling strategy.

It rests on a simple observation from 1970s database theory: a system does two very different jobs — a write (a "command") is a one-way action that mutates the system and has side effects; a read (a "query") is a side-effect-free lookup that returns data. When you force both through the *same* model, that model becomes a compromise that is good at neither. CQRS deliberately splits them so each half can be optimized for its own job.

A quick word on the name: "Responsibility Segregation" just means "give each responsibility its own class/module/component" — it's the same idea as Separation of Concerns applied to reads vs. writes.

TRADITIONAL (single model) vs CQRS (split models):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  TRADITIONAL CRUD — ONE model does everything:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

            ┌──────────────────────────┐
   write ──►│                          │
   (POST)   │    ONE DOMAIN MODEL      │──► reads hit the SAME
            │    ONE DATABASE          │    structure as writes
   read  ──►│    ONE SERVICE           │
   (GET)    │                          │
            └──────────────────────────┘
              • Model is a compromise: it must serve both
                mutation and query shapes.
              • Read scaling = write scaling (coupled).
              • A heavy write lock blocks reads, and vice versa.


  CQRS — TWO models, each optimized for its own job:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

          ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
   write ─►│  COMMAND SIDE │        │  QUERY SIDE   │◄─ read
   (POST)  │  (Write Model)│        │ (Read Model)  │   (GET)
   ──────►│  validates    │        │  denormalized │
          │  business rules│        │  pre-joined   │
          │  persists     │        │  fast reads   │
          └──────┬───────┘         └──────────────┘
                 │      separate stores,
                 │      separate scale
                 ▼         ↑ sync (sync call or async event)
          [WRITE DB]       [READ DB / READ-ONLY REPLICA / CACHE]

              • Commands: strict, validated, consistency-first.
              • Queries: loose, denormalized, speed-first.
              • Each side scales and is deployed independently.

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  KEY IDEA: the write path and read path are DIFFERENT       │
  │  shapes, so give them DIFFERENT models instead of one       │
  │  bloated compromise.                                        │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

When to use it (it is NOT for every app):
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  GOOD FIT (use CQRS):                                      │
  │  • Read-heavy systems: 10×–1000× more reads than writes    │
  │  • The read shape is very different from the write shape   │
  │    (write tiny/normalized, read wide/denormalized)         │
  │  • Write and read need different scaling (bursty writes,   │
  │    heavy analytic reads)                                   │
  │  • Teams need to optimize each side independently          │
  │                                                            │
  │  BAD FIT (skip it):                                        │
  │  • Simple CRUD CRUD — a single model is simpler            │
  │  • No read/write asymmetry → CQRS adds complexity          │
  │  • You need strong, immediate read-your-writes consistency │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

CQRS is often (but not always) paired with **Event Sourcing** — commands produce events that are replayed to build the read model. They are separate patterns that complement each other; CQRS can exist without Event Sourcing.

### Example:

A ticketing platform where 99% of traffic is people *viewing* event seats (reads) and only a tiny fraction is actually *booking* (writes).

```
WITHOUT CQRS — every page-view and every booking hit ONE table
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

            ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
 1000/s     │         [events] + [seats] JOIN        │
 reads ───► │    ONE relational model + indexes      │
            │                                        │
  2/s       │   • Seat lookups run heavy JOINs.      │
 writes ──► │   • Every read pays the write-model    │
            │     cost (normalization, locking).     │
            │   • A long booking transaction can     │
            │     block page-view reads.             │
            └────────────────────────────────────────┘
            PROBLEM: reads are slow, writes are rare,
            but they're stuck in the same bottleneck.


WITH CQRS — reads get a model built just for viewing
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Book seat (POST /book)                 View seats (GET /seats)
       │                                        ▲
       ▼                                        │
  ┌────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────────────┐
  │ COMMAND SIDE   │            │ QUERY SIDE               │
  │ write model    │            │ read model               │
  │ • validates    │            │ • pre-joined, flat rows  │
  │   seat exists  │            │ • e.g. "seat: A-12,      │
  │ • checks price │            │   row: front, price: 80, │
  │ • holds lock   │            │   status: FREE"          │
  │ • persists     │            │ • served from cache /    │
  └───────┬────────┘            │   read replica           │
          │                     └────────────▲─────────────┘
          │  emits event                        │ subscribed
          ▼  "SeatBooked"                        │ to events
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │   ASYNC SYNC: write DB → (event) → read DB/cache     │
  │   (event bus / CDC / message queue)                  │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  RESULT:
  • 1000/s page-views are served from a flat, cacheable,
    denormalized read model — sub-millisecond, no JOINs.
  • The rare 2/s bookings use strict validation and locking
    on the write side, without contending with reads.
  • The read model can be scaled out to N replicas freely;
    the write side stays small and correct.
  • Cost: tiny lag between booking and the read model
    catching up (eventual consistency on the read side).
```

The team gets fast, cacheable reads AND strict, correct writes — each tuned for its own workload instead of one model compromising both.
